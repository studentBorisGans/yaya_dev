# Theres a conflict in my setup. In order for my grpc server to work, the code in the generated pb2_grpc.py python file (from proto) needs to import the other generated python file as such: import write_service_pb2 as write__service__pb2. However, my FastAPI endpoint needs to access these files as well to create the stub and channel, as well as accessing the functions.
